To create an engaging and educational game to test a user's memory through flipping a series of cards to create matching pairs. 

## Criteria provided by Code Institute 
 
### External user’s goal: 
The site's users are keen to test their memory and responsivity skills through an engaging card game. They want to improve their score (number of moves) and might have an interest in learning the names of extinct megafauna animals. 

### Site owner's goal:
To create an engaging game to which users will return. 

### Features to include:

Site navigation should be sufficient so that use of the back button isn’t necessary.
